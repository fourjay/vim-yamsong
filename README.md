# Edit JSON as YAML

YAML is a superset of JSON :-)

In general YAML is easier to edit then JSON.

* It's more forgiving of formatting
* No need for quoting every attribute and value

This vim plugin creates a vim split from a buffer with filetype=json and
converts it to yaml for editing. 

It's not yet ready :-)
