1. INTRODUCTION                                                  *yamsong-intro*

YAML is a superset of JSON

JSON is consumed well by machines, but fidgity to write. YAML is much easier
for humans to write by hand. This plugin provides a YAML scratch buffer to edit
JSON in YAML

==============================================================================
2. USAGE                                                        *yamsong-usage*

If JSON |filetype| is set, a local command is created *Edityaml*
This

* opens a vertical split buffer
* creates a YAML version of the current JSON file
* Allows toggling the scratch buffer between formats, with Diff view to the
  original JSON buffer when scratch buffer is in JSON mode

The scratch buffer is memory only. It adds a few additions.

* A :Toggle function, mapped to <CR> to toggle the scratch buffer between modes
* A buffer local command :Write to write the scratch JSON buffer back to the
* original JSON file.

==============================================================================
3. OTHER                                                         *yamsong-other*

This depends on python3 being executable somewhere in your path. Python3
typically has JSON and YAML modules, and is installed on almost all reasonably
current Linux systems (and I'd venture a good number Windows developer vim
installs).

The code is not inline, in part as it does not need to be, and in part to not
require vim to be compiled with python3 support.
